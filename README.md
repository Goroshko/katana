## Install

If you downloaded sabre/katana as an archive, skip the pre-requisites.

### Pre-requisites

To grab dependencies of the project, make sure you have [Composer], [Bower] and
[NPM] installed, and then run:

```sh
$ make install
```

(Note: You can run `make clean` to clean extra files needed for the
installation).

Then, to install sabre/katana, you have two options.

### In your browser

You need to start an HTTP server; example with the PHP built-in server:

```sh
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8888 -t public public/.webserver.php
```

Then open
[`http://127.0.0.1:8888/install.php`](http://127.0.0.1:8888/install.php) in your
browser, you will be redirected to the installation page.

### In your terminal

You need to execute the following command:

 ```sh
 $ bin/katana install
 ```

## Update

To update sabre/katana, you have two options.

### In your browser

So far, only a message will prompt you, indicating how to update manually.
We are working on an automatic update in the browser.

### In your terminal

  1. First solution is **manual** but more common. It requires a ZIP archive.
     Download the latest versions with the following command:

     ```sh
     $ bin/katana update --fetch-zip
     ```

     You will find the archives in the `data/share/update/` directory. To
     finish updating sabre/katana, simply run:

     ```sh
     $ unzip -u data/share/update/katana_vx.y.z.zip -d .
     ```

  2. Second solution is **automatic** but less common. It requires a [PHAR]
     archive. Download the latest versions with the following command:

     ```sh
     $ bin/katana update --fetch
     ```

     You will also find the archives in the `data/share/update/` directory. To
     finish updating sabre/katana, simply run:

     ```sh
     $ bin/katana update --apply data/share/update/katana_vx.y.z.phar
     ```

     The PHAR is executable. For instance:

     ```sh
     $ php data/share/update/katana_vx.y.z.phar --signature
     ```

     or

     ```sh
     $ php data/share/update/katana_vx.y.z.phar --metadata
     ```

     will respectively print the signature and the metadata of this version. Use
     `-h`, `-?` or `--help` to get help.

## Raw backup

So far, it is possible to only create a backup in your terminal, by using the
following commands. To create a ZIP archive:

```sh
$ bin/katana stub --zip
```

To create an executable PHAR archive:

```sh
$ bin/katana stub --phar
```

**⚠️ Warning**: The current command does not backup the MySQL database.

## Supported technologies

So far, sabre/katana can be installed with [SQLite] or [MySQL]. It works in all
major browsers, except prior versions of IE9.
